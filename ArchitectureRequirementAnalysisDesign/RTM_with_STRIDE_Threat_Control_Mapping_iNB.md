## Notes

• Threat IDs refer to the STRIDE threat model entries (TM-*). The “Control Mapping (from STRIDE)” column summarizes the key controls that mitigate those threats.

• For audit readiness, map each control to evidence (scan report, DR drill report, pen-test report, monitoring dashboard screenshots) in the next iteration.
